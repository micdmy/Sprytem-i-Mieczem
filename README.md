How to add a new race:

1.) Add name of the new race in the file RACES.json. Let's assume the name of the race is xxx

2.) Create directory named xxx in img/l and put all race-relevant pictures in it (192x192 pixels, format png)

3.) Create file race_xxx.json. Fields named "src" should be paths to respective image files, relative to img/l/ directory
